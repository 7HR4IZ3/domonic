# Hi, Welcome to the docs.


If there's something you want to see documented or is incorrect feel free to send a pull request.


To build:


```
cd docs
make html
```

You will get several Warnings but if the build succeeds you're probably good.

You may need to install the dev requirements. But if you want you can just install sphinx.
