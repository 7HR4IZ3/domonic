#### Code of Conduct

Everyone contributing to domonic, and in particular in our
issue tracker, pull requests, is expected to treat other people with respect.

First Time Contributors
-----------------------

domonic appreciates your contribution! If you are interested in helping improve
domonic, there are several ways to get started:


* Docs - learn to publish the sphinx docs and make some small edits.

    cd docs
    make html


* Unit Test - These are severely lacking and writing them uncovers bugs. Try to start everthing you are doing with tests.


Submitting Changes
------------------

Ideally you can make a fork and submit a pull request and I'll try to review it and add the udpates as soon as possible to a release.

Try to do unit tests if you can and add new ones to the test files if you need to. There is usually a test file for each class or package.

The best thing is to commit little and often. single functions and unit tests. Making sure all existing tests pass (unless they were incorrect).


Preparing Changes
-----------------

Before you begin: if your change will be a significant amount of work
to write, we highly recommend starting by opening an issue laying out
what you want to do.  That lets a conversation happen early in case
other contributors disagree with what you'd like to do or have ideas
that will help you do it.


I'd like to get the conventions as good as possbile but it's a big project with a lot to do.

I'm severly behind on unit tests and documentation.

If you want you can also raise a bug and suggest a fix as a comment. If you have patched something locally and just want to suggest the change but don't feel confident setting everything up just put a message dicussion board.


Issue-tracker conventions
-------------------------

I aim to reply to all issues promptly but I may not be able for somethings or might be busy so please also be patient.
